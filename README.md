# V E G A N

The goal of this project is to create a website advocating for veganism.
In particular, the website tries to mimic a video or automatically-timed
slide deck, with rotating text, image, and video content on one page. 


*Current Status:* a basic infrastructure to support rotating multimedia is
in place, but lots of work to be done still to make more compelling
and expressive websites.
